# Brain-Tumor-Extraction-From-MRI-images
This project segments the tumor from MRI images using k-means, watershed, MSER, Otsuâ€™s thresholding and graythresh segmentation techniques. Normalized cross correlation technique is also performed to compare the extracted tumor with the template tumor and achieved an accuracy of 85% in extracting the right tumor from brain images.
